The Datetime Module:

# To make a date you pass in 3 numbers: year-month-day
# You can access year, month, day seperately
# timedelta (a datetime class) lets you add or substract a number of days from a date
  & by printing the sum you can find the exact date after a number of days have passed
# By default dates are printed in this format: yyyy-mm-dd
# You can specify a different format by creating a format code
  1st method, use the strftime method and pass the format string
  2nd method, create a string with the format; insert format by starting with an open brace followed by a colon than close brace
